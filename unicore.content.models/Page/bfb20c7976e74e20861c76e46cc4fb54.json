But you\u2019re super busy at school or at home with studying and helping with the cooking and cleaning. There seems to be no time for exercise! \r\n\r\nHere are some sneaky ways to get moving\u2026 \r\n\r\nDance and dress\r\nWhen you\u2019re getting dressed for school in the morning, why not put on your favorite song and dance like nobody\u2019s watching? You\u2019ll be surprised how energized and upbeat you feel. \r\n\r\nDo abs during ads\r\nThe next time you\u2019re watching TV with a friend or listening to your favorite radio drama with your siblings, challenge them to see who can do the most sit-ups or jumping jacks during the ad break. \r\n\r\nHouse help\r\nHow many times do you get asked to help out around the house? It may seem pretty boring to hang up the washing or clean the floor, but put some music on and pretend the mop or broom is your guitar or microphone. Not only will the chore be over in no time, but you\u2019ve practiced your singing skills and filled your body with feel-good hormones called endorphins \u2013 these keep sad thoughts far away! \r\n\r\nPut your phone down\r\nGive your texting fingers a break and rather talk face-to-face with your friends while you go for a walk - just make sure that you always stick together and that you walk somewhere safe. Laughing out loud with friends while getting some fresh air fills your body with good feelings, plus your stomach and leg muscles get a workout. That is way better than a smiley emoticon. \r\n\r\nBabysitter boot camp\r\nHave you been asked to look after your baby sister or the neighbor\u2019s son? Why not take a break from school and studying and be a proper child again. Challenge them to fun jumping games, play hide and seek or catch a ball. You could even teach them one of your favorite games that you played when you were young! Take the \u2018sit\u2019 out of babysitter!",
